## Experiment code for IPCK
This is the code demo for the paper ''Incorprating Prompt tuning for Commit classification with prior Knowledge(IPCK)''.In order to easily reproduce our method, we use pip freeze > requirements.txt to output the packages used in our experimental environment. you can try pip install -r requirements.txt to obtain the similar environment with us.

You can validate the experiment result and our framework directly from one notebook. Each notebook is for one experiment result.  For example, in folder notebook/E-5, it means the experiments for 5 shots scenario.
